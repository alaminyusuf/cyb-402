## Modeling Fault Tolerance in a Distributed Application

### Project Description

In this mini-project, as Level 400 students of Cyber Security, you are to design a simple
client-server or distributed application that demonstrates the concept of fault tolerance.
The system should continue operating despite the introduction of certain faults.
You are required to simulate different types of faults and apply any tolerance techniques
to show how the system maintains reliability, a concept critical in building resilient and
secure systems.

### Project Objectives

The project specific objectives are as follows:

1. To understand and model different types of system faults in computing systems.
2. To demonstrate the impact of faults on security and system performance.
3. To apply fault-tolerance techniques such as redundancy or replication for
resilience.
4. To document findings clearly with supporting evidence and relate them to cyber
security contexts.

### Scope of Work

▪ Design a small application (can be in any programming language).
▪ Introduce at least two types of faults (e.g., crash faults, omission faults).
▪ Apply fault-tolerance techniques (e.g., redundancy, replication, or checkpoint
recovery).
▪ Demonstrate recovery through a short test run or screenshots.
▪ Prepare a short report (3 to 5 pages) summarizing your design, methods, results
and lessons learned.
Deliverables (What to Submit)
▪ Source code or simulation file.
▪ Screenshots/outputs showing fault scenarios and recovery.
▪ Final report (3 to 5 pages).

Group Size: Three (3) students per group. Grouping arrangements will be shared later.
Submission Deadline: Tuesday 9th September, 2025.
Submission Format: Hard copy report + soft copy (code/report) via
